## Work on Mathematical Sets of a Discrete Nature


The Python program must read a .txt file that contains the number of operations, the type of operation (union, intersection, difference or Cartesian product) and the sets involved. 
The file format includes:

First line: number of operations.
Sets of three lines:
Letter to define the operation (U: union, I: intersection, D: difference, C: Cartesian product),
Elements from set 1,
Elements from set 2.
The file to be read is passed as a parameter on the command line. Examples of file names: output.txt, output3.txt.
